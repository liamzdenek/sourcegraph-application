# Product Context: Cody Batch

## Why This Project Exists
Cody Batch is designed as a showcase application to demonstrate the potential of AI-powered code modification at scale. It serves as both a practical tool for repository maintenance and a demonstration of the applicant's technical skills and understanding of Sourcegraph's vision for AI coding agents.

The project aligns with Steve Yegge's vision (as described in his blog post "Revenge of the junior developer") of AI coding agents that can work autonomously on specific tasks, demonstrating how AI can be leveraged to solve real-world software engineering problems at scale.

## Problems It Solves

### For Repository Owners
1. **Security Vulnerability Management**: Automatically identifies and fixes security vulnerabilities across multiple repositories, starting with Log4J CVE remediation.
2. **Technical Debt Reduction**: Enables bulk updates to outdated dependencies or deprecated code patterns.
3. **Consistency Enforcement**: Ensures coding standards and best practices are applied uniformly across repositories.
4. **Time Savings**: Reduces manual effort required for repetitive code maintenance tasks.

### For Sourcegraph (as a job application showcase)
1. **Demonstrates Understanding**: Shows deep understanding of Sourcegraph's vision for AI coding agents.
2. **Technical Proficiency**: Showcases ability to build complex, production-ready systems.
3. **Innovation**: Presents a novel application of Claude 3.7 for autonomous code modification.
4. **Alignment**: Aligns with Sourcegraph's mission to make code changes and understanding more accessible.

## How It Should Work

### User Flow
1. **Job Creation**: User specifies a type of change (e.g., "Fix Log4J CVE") and selects target repositories.
2. **Authentication**: User authenticates with GitHub to grant necessary permissions.
3. **Job Processing**: System scans repositories, analyzes code, and generates fixes using Claude 3.7.
4. **Result Delivery**: 
   - For owned repositories: Creates pull requests with fixes
   - For non-owned repositories: Generates diffs for manual review
5. **Monitoring**: User can track job progress and view results through the dashboard.

### System Flow
1. **Repository Scanning**: Identify repositories matching criteria and clone/analyze them.
2. **Issue Detection**: Scan code for specific patterns or vulnerabilities.
3. **Fix Generation**: Use Claude 3.7 to generate appropriate fixes.
4. **Validation**: Verify that generated fixes address the issue without breaking functionality.
5. **Delivery**: Create pull requests or store diffs based on repository ownership.
6. **Reporting**: Provide detailed reports on actions taken and results.

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity
- Clear, intuitive interface for job creation and monitoring
- Minimal configuration required to get started
- Straightforward result presentation

### Transparency
- Detailed logging of all actions taken
- Clear explanation of changes made
- Visibility into Claude's reasoning process

### Control
- Ability to review changes before they're submitted
- Options to customize fix strategies
- Capability to pause or cancel jobs

### Scalability
- Handle multiple repositories efficiently
- Process large codebases without performance degradation
- Support parallel job execution

### Security
- Strict permission controls for GitHub access
- Limited scope of automated changes (only to specified repositories)
- Secure handling of authentication credentials
