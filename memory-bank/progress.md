# Progress: Cody Batch

## Current Status

The project is in the **initial planning and setup phase**. We have:

- ✅ Defined the project concept and goals
- ✅ Established the high-level architecture
- ✅ Determined the technology stack
- ✅ Created the memory bank documentation
- ⏳ Setting up the Nx monorepo structure (in progress)

## Recent Updates

Based on feedback, we've made several important architectural adjustments:

- ✅ Switched from Lambda to AWS Batch for job processing to handle long-running jobs
- ✅ Removed frontend OAuth flow in favor of a service account approach
- ✅ Made the tool generic for any prompt, not just vulnerability detection
- ✅ Added a limit of 5 repositories per request for cost containment
- ✅ Simplified secrets management to use environment variables
- ✅ Added support for downloading patch files and viewing Claude message threads
- ✅ Updated CloudFront deployment to use BucketDeployment for automatic invalidation

## What Works

As the project is in the initial setup phase, no components are fully implemented yet. The following have been established:

- ✅ Project vision and requirements
- ✅ Architecture design
- ✅ Technology selection
- ✅ Development approach

## Known Issues

As the project is in the initial planning phase, there are no implementation issues yet. However, we have identified the following potential challenges:

1. **AWS Batch Job Duration**:
   - Long-running repository analyses might require careful resource management
   - Mitigation: Implement job chunking and progress tracking

2. **GitHub API Rate Limits**:
   - Scanning large repositories might hit GitHub API rate limits
   - Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies

3. **Claude API Token Limits**:
   - Large code files might exceed Claude's context window
   - Mitigation: Develop strategies for chunking and context management

4. **DynamoDB Query Limitations**:
   - Complex queries might be challenging with DynamoDB
   - Mitigation: Design efficient access patterns and consider secondary indexes

5. **Pull Request Management**:
   - Need to store and reuse pull request links for repositories
   - Mitigation: Implement robust PR tracking and status management

6. **Patch File Size**:
   - Large diffs might exceed DynamoDB item size limits
   - Mitigation: Store large diffs in S3 and references in DynamoDB

## Next Milestone

**Initial Project Setup (Target: Day 1-2)**
- Complete Nx workspace initialization
- Set up all packages with basic structure
- Configure build and deployment process
- Implement basic health check endpoint
- Create initial frontend shell
