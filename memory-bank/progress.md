# Progress: Cody Batch

## Current Status

The project is in the **initial planning and setup phase**. We have:

- ✅ Defined the project concept and goals
- ✅ Established the high-level architecture
- ✅ Determined the technology stack
- ✅ Created the memory bank documentation
- ✅ Set up the Nx monorepo structure
- ✅ Initialized all required packages:
  - shared
  - github-client
  - claude-client
  - api
  - batch
  - frontend (with Vite)
  - cdk
- ✅ Implemented the API package with Express and Lambda integration
- ✅ Implemented the GitHub client with Octokit and simple-git
- ✅ Implemented the shared package with types, schemas, utilities, and configuration
- ✅ Fixed ESLint configuration for dependency checks
- ✅ Implemented the Claude client with tool-based interaction

## Recent Updates

Based on feedback, we've made several important architectural adjustments:

- ✅ Switched from Lambda to AWS Batch for job processing to handle long-running jobs
- ✅ Removed frontend OAuth flow in favor of a service account approach
- ✅ Made the tool generic for any prompt, not just vulnerability detection
- ✅ Added a limit of 5 repositories per request for cost containment
- ✅ Simplified secrets management to use environment variables
- ✅ Added support for downloading patch files and viewing Claude message threads
- ✅ Updated CloudFront deployment to use BucketDeployment for automatic invalidation
- ✅ Configured API package to use ESM modules
- ✅ Set up frontend with Vite instead of Webpack
- ✅ Implemented GitHub client with repository operations and pull request creation
- ✅ Implemented shared package with Zod schemas for validation
- ✅ Replaced deprecated generatePackageJson option with ESLint dependency checks
- ✅ Implemented Claude client with tool-based interaction, token usage tracking, and autonomous sessions

## Known Issues

1. **API Package ESM Configuration**:
   - When using ESM modules, file extensions must be included in import statements
   - Mitigation: Updated import statements to include .js extension for compiled output

2. **AWS Batch Job Duration**:
   - Long-running repository analyses might require careful resource management
   - Mitigation: Implement job chunking and progress tracking

3. **GitHub API Rate Limits**:
   - Scanning large repositories might hit GitHub API rate limits
   - Mitigation: Implemented rate limit checking and management in GitHub client

4. **Claude API Token Limits**:
   - Large code files might exceed Claude's context window
   - Mitigation: Develop strategies for chunking and context management

5. **DynamoDB Query Limitations**:
   - Complex queries might be challenging with DynamoDB
   - Mitigation: Design efficient access patterns and consider secondary indexes

6. **Claude Tool Execution**:
   - Tool execution might fail due to errors in the repository
   - Mitigation: Implemented robust error handling in tools

## Next Milestone

**Batch Processing Implementation (Target: Day 5-7)**
- Connect API to GitHub and Claude clients
- Set up DynamoDB for persistent storage
- Create initial frontend components
- Implement batch job processing framework
- Integrate Claude client with batch processing
