## Known Issues

1. **API Package ESM Configuration**:
   - When using ESM modules, file extensions must be included in import statements
   - Mitigation: Updated import statements to include .js extension for compiled output

2. **AWS Batch Job Duration**:
   - Long-running repository analyses might require careful resource management
   - Mitigation: Implement job chunking and progress tracking

3. **GitHub API Rate Limits**:
   - Scanning large repositories might hit GitHub API rate limits
   - Mitigation: Implemented rate limit checking and management in GitHub client

4. **Claude API Token Limits**:
   - Large code files might exceed Claude's context window
   - Mitigation: Develop strategies for chunking and context management

5. **DynamoDB Query Limitations**:
   - Complex queries might be challenging with DynamoDB
   - Mitigation: Design efficient access patterns and consider secondary indexes

6. **Claude Tool Execution**:
   - Tool execution might fail due to errors in the repository
   - Mitigation: Implemented robust error handling in tools

7. **Claude API Version Compatibility**:
   - Different Claude models require different API endpoints
   - Mitigation: Implemented direct API calls with proper headers and error handling

8. **Path Resolution in Repository Tools**:
   - Relative paths can be tricky when working with repositories
   - Mitigation: Added path resolution logic and validation in tool execution

9. **Claude API Rate Limits**:
   - Claude API has rate limits that need to be respected
   - Mitigation: Added rate limit header logging and prepared for backoff strategy implementation

10. **Conversation History Storage Gap**:
    - Current DynamoDB schema only stores `finalMessage` and `threadId`
    - Frontend expects full conversation history with all messages and timestamps
    - Mitigation: Updated DynamoDB schema with comprehensive `claudeConversation` structure

11. **Large Conversation Histories**:
    - Conversation histories with many tool calls could become very large
    - Mitigation: Consider compression or chunking for very large conversations

12. **Frontend Rendering of Tool Interactions**:
    - Tool calls and results need specialized rendering
    - Mitigation: Plan to implement technical and simplified view modes

## Next Milestone

**Batch Processing Implementation (Target: Day 5-7)**
- Connect API to GitHub and Claude clients
- Set up DynamoDB for persistent storage with updated schema
- Create initial frontend components with conversation viewing
- Implement batch job processing framework
- Integrate Claude client with batch processing
- Implement conversation history formatting and storage
