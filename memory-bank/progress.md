# Progress: Cody Batch

## Current Status

The project is in the **initial planning and setup phase**. We have:

- ✅ Defined the project concept and goals
- ✅ Established the high-level architecture
- ✅ Determined the technology stack
- ✅ Created the memory bank documentation
- ⏳ Setting up the Nx monorepo structure (in progress)

## What Works

As the project is in the initial setup phase, no components are fully implemented yet. The following have been established:

- ✅ Project vision and requirements
- ✅ Architecture design
- ✅ Technology selection
- ✅ Development approach

## Known Issues

As the project is in the initial planning phase, there are no implementation issues yet. However, we have identified the following potential challenges:

1. **Lambda Execution Time Limits**:
   - Long-running repository analyses might exceed the 15-minute Lambda timeout
   - Mitigation: Implement job chunking and continuation strategies

2. **GitHub API Rate Limits**:
   - Scanning large repositories might hit GitHub API rate limits
   - Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies

3. **Claude API Token Limits**:
   - Large code files might exceed Claude's context window
   - Mitigation: Develop strategies for chunking and context management

4. **DynamoDB Query Limitations**:
   - Complex queries might be challenging with DynamoDB
   - Mitigation: Design efficient access patterns and consider secondary indexes

5. **Cold Start Latency**:
   - Lambda cold starts might impact user experience
   - Mitigation: Optimize package size and consider provisioned concurrency for critical functions

## Next Milestone

**Initial Project Setup (Target: Day 1-2)**
- Complete Nx workspace initialization
- Set up all packages with basic structure
- Configure build and deployment process
- Implement basic health check endpoint
- Create initial frontend shell
