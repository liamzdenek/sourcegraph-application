## Known Issues

1. **API Package ESM Configuration**:
   - When using ESM modules, file extensions must be included in import statements
   - Mitigation: Updated import statements to include .js extension for compiled output

2. **AWS Batch Job Duration**:
   - Long-running repository analyses might require careful resource management
   - Mitigation: Implement job chunking and progress tracking

3. **GitHub API Rate Limits**:
   - Scanning large repositories might hit GitHub API rate limits
   - Mitigation: Implemented rate limit checking and management in GitHub client

4. **Claude API Token Limits**:
   - Large code files might exceed Claude's context window
   - Mitigation: Develop strategies for chunking and context management

5. **DynamoDB Query Limitations**:
   - Complex queries might be challenging with DynamoDB
   - Mitigation: Design efficient access patterns and consider secondary indexes

6. **Claude Tool Execution**:
   - Tool execution might fail due to errors in the repository
   - Mitigation: Implemented robust error handling in tools

7. **Claude API Version Compatibility**:
   - Different Claude models require different API endpoints
   - Mitigation: Implemented direct API calls with proper headers and error handling

8. **Path Resolution in Repository Tools**:
   - Relative paths can be tricky when working with repositories
   - Mitigation: Added path resolution logic and validation in tool execution

9. **Claude API Rate Limits**:
   - Claude API has rate limits that need to be respected
   - Mitigation: Added rate limit header logging and prepared for backoff strategy implementation

10. **Conversation History Storage Gap**:
    - Current DynamoDB schema only stores `finalMessage` and `threadId`
    - Frontend expects full conversation history with all messages and timestamps
    - Mitigation: Updated DynamoDB schema with comprehensive `claudeConversation` structure

11. **Large Conversation Histories**:
    - Conversation histories with many tool calls could become very large
    - Mitigation: Consider compression or chunking for very large conversations

12. **Frontend Rendering of Tool Interactions**:
    - Tool calls and results need specialized rendering
    - Mitigation: Implemented technical and simplified view modes

13. **Local Testing Without DynamoDB**:
    - The batch processor requires DynamoDB for persistent storage
    - Mitigation: Created a test script that simulates job creation for local testing

14. **Environment Variable Management**:
    - Multiple packages require the same environment variables
    - Mitigation: Created .env.example files for each package with documentation

15. **Frontend API Integration**:
    - Frontend needs to connect to actual API endpoints
    - Mitigation: Implemented API service layer with error handling

16. **CDK Deployment Profile**:
    - Need to use the AWS profile "lz-demos" for deployment
    - Mitigation: Configure CDK to use the specified profile

17. **Environment Variable Injection**:
    - Frontend needs environment variables injected at build time
    - Mitigation: Use BucketDeployment with custom bundling to inject variables

18. **Type Safety in Frontend Components**:
    - API responses may have optional properties that need to be handled
    - Mitigation: Updated components to handle optional properties with null checks and fallbacks

19. **Dependency Management in Frontend**:
    - Some dependencies like syntax highlighter may be missing
    - Mitigation: Install required dependencies and update package.json

20. **CDK Deployment Permission Issues**:
    - Permission issues with CDK build and deployment
    - Mitigation: Clean up the CDK output directory and retry deployment

21. **CDK App Parameter Required**:
    - CDK deploy requires the --app parameter
    - Mitigation: Update the deploy command to use --app ./main.js

22. **API Lambda ESM Module Exports**:
    - Lambda requires ESM exports to be properly configured
    - Mitigation: Update the handler export to use ESM export syntax

23. **Environment Variable Validation**:
    - Some environment variables are required, others are optional
    - Mitigation: Update environment variable validation to distinguish between required and optional variables

24. **AWS Batch Job Shows AWS CLI Help**:
    - AWS Batch job runs but only shows AWS CLI help text
    - Mitigation: Create proper Docker image for batch job and push to ECR

25. **Docker Image Build and Push**:
    - Need to build and push Docker image for batch job
    - Mitigation: Create Dockerfile and add build/push commands to project.json

26. **ECR Repository Not Found During Docker Tag**:
    - Docker tag command fails because ECR repository doesn't exist yet
    - Mitigation: Create deploy-batch-with-ecr command to deploy CDK stack first, then build and push Docker image

27. **CDK Build Permission Issues**:
    - Permission issues with CDK build and deployment
    - Mitigation: Add cleanup step to remove previous build artifacts before building

28. **Deployment Process Complexity**:
    - Multiple commands needed for complete deployment
    - Mitigation: Consolidate all deployment steps into a single comprehensive command

29. **ECR Login Issues**:
    - Variables not persisting across commands in nx:run-commands
    - Mitigation: Combine commands with && operators to preserve variables

30. **Missing Dependencies in Batch Job**:
    - Error: Cannot find module 'zod-to-json-schema', '@octokit/rest', 'simple-git', 'glob'
    - Mitigation: Add missing dependencies to batch package.json and update documentation

31. **Frontend API URL Environment Variable Not Set**:
    - Frontend shows "loading job details" forever due to incorrect API URL
    - Mitigation: Use build-frontend target in deploy command to set API URL environment variable

32. **Docker Build Performance**:
    - Docker build is slow due to suboptimal layer ordering
    - Mitigation: Optimize Dockerfile layer ordering to put rarely changing layers first (system dependencies, then package dependencies, then application code)
