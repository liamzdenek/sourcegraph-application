# Progress: Cody Batch

## Current Status

The project is in the **initial planning and setup phase**. We have:

- ✅ Defined the project concept and goals
- ✅ Established the high-level architecture
- ✅ Determined the technology stack
- ✅ Created the memory bank documentation
- ✅ Set up the Nx monorepo structure
- ✅ Initialized all required packages:
  - shared
  - github-client
  - claude-client
  - api
  - batch
  - frontend (with Vite)
  - cdk
- ✅ Implemented the API package with Express and Lambda integration

## Recent Updates

Based on feedback, we've made several important architectural adjustments:

- ✅ Switched from Lambda to AWS Batch for job processing to handle long-running jobs
- ✅ Removed frontend OAuth flow in favor of a service account approach
- ✅ Made the tool generic for any prompt, not just vulnerability detection
- ✅ Added a limit of 5 repositories per request for cost containment
- ✅ Simplified secrets management to use environment variables
- ✅ Added support for downloading patch files and viewing Claude message threads
- ✅ Updated CloudFront deployment to use BucketDeployment for automatic invalidation
- ✅ Configured API package to use ESM modules
- ✅ Set up frontend with Vite instead of Webpack

## What Works

The following components are now functional:

- ✅ Project vision and requirements
- ✅ Architecture design
- ✅ Technology selection
- ✅ Development approach
- ✅ API package with Express and Lambda integration
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Repository listing endpoint
- ✅ Job management endpoints

## Known Issues

1. **API Package ESM Configuration**:
   - When using ESM modules, file extensions must be included in import statements
   - Mitigation: Updated import statements to include .js extension for compiled output

2. **AWS Batch Job Duration**:
   - Long-running repository analyses might require careful resource management
   - Mitigation: Implement job chunking and progress tracking

3. **GitHub API Rate Limits**:
   - Scanning large repositories might hit GitHub API rate limits
   - Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies

4. **Claude API Token Limits**:
   - Large code files might exceed Claude's context window
   - Mitigation: Develop strategies for chunking and context management

5. **DynamoDB Query Limitations**:
   - Complex queries might be challenging with DynamoDB
   - Mitigation: Design efficient access patterns and consider secondary indexes

6. **Pull Request Management**:
   - Need to store and reuse pull request links for repositories
   - Mitigation: Implement robust PR tracking and status management

7. **Patch File Size**:
   - Large diffs might exceed DynamoDB item size limits
   - Mitigation: Store large diffs in S3 and references in DynamoDB

## Next Milestone

**Package Implementation (Target: Day 3-5)**
- Implement the GitHub client
- Implement the Claude client
- Connect API to clients and DynamoDB
- Set up basic CDK infrastructure
- Create initial frontend components
- Implement batch job processing framework
