# Claude Client Design

This document outlines the design decisions and architecture of the Claude client.

## Architecture

The Claude client is designed to facilitate autonomous code analysis and modification using the Claude API. It follows a tool-based approach where Claude can use various tools to interact with a repository.

### Components

1. **ClaudeClient**: The main client for interacting with the Claude API. It manages the conversation with Claude and handles tool execution.

2. **ToolRegistry**: A registry of tools that Claude can use to interact with the repository. It provides a way to register tools and execute them.

3. **Tools**: Individual tools that Claude can use to interact with the repository, such as listing files, reading file contents, writing to files, and searching for patterns in code.

4. **ClaudeContext**: A context object that provides information about the current session, such as the repository path and session ID.

## Design Decisions

### Tool-Based Approach

We chose a tool-based approach to allow Claude to interact with the repository in a structured way. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Structured Interaction**: Tools provide a structured way for Claude to interact with the repository, making it easier to understand and debug.

2. **Extensibility**: New tools can be added to extend the functionality of the client without modifying the core client code.

3. **Safety**: Tools can implement safety checks to prevent Claude from performing dangerous operations.

### Autonomous Sessions

The client is designed to run autonomous sessions where Claude can analyze and modify code without human intervention. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Efficiency**: Autonomous sessions can run without human intervention, making them more efficient.

2. **Consistency**: Autonomous sessions follow a consistent approach to code analysis and modification.

3. **Scalability**: Autonomous sessions can be scaled to handle large repositories or multiple repositories.

### Token Usage Tracking

The client tracks token usage to help manage costs. This is important for several reasons:

1. **Cost Management**: Token usage tracking helps manage costs by providing visibility into how many tokens are being used.

2. **Optimization**: Token usage tracking can help identify opportunities for optimization, such as using prompt caching.

3. **Budgeting**: Token usage tracking can help with budgeting by providing estimates of how many tokens will be used for a given task.

### Prompt Caching

The client supports prompt caching to improve performance and reduce costs. This is important for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Prompt caching can improve performance by reducing the number of tokens that need to be processed.

2. **Cost Reduction**: Prompt caching can reduce costs by reducing the number of tokens that need to be processed.

3. **Consistency**: Prompt caching can improve consistency by ensuring that Claude has access to the same context across multiple iterations.

## Implementation Considerations

### Error Handling

The client implements robust error handling to ensure that errors are properly reported and don't cause the session to fail. This includes:

1. **Tool Execution Errors**: Errors that occur during tool execution are caught and reported to Claude, allowing it to handle them appropriately.

2. **API Errors**: Errors that occur when interacting with the Claude API are caught and reported, allowing the client to handle them appropriately.

3. **Timeout Handling**: The client handles timeouts to ensure that sessions don't run indefinitely.

### Iteration Limits

The client implements iteration limits to prevent sessions from running indefinitely. This is important for several reasons:

1. **Cost Control**: Iteration limits help control costs by preventing sessions from running indefinitely.

2. **Progress Tracking**: Iteration limits provide a way to track progress and ensure that sessions are making progress.

3. **Error Detection**: Iteration limits can help detect errors by identifying sessions that are not making progress.

### Conversation Management

The client manages the conversation with Claude to ensure that it has the necessary context to perform the task. This includes:

1. **System Message**: The client provides a system message to set the context for the conversation.

2. **Tool Results**: The client provides tool results to Claude to allow it to make informed decisions.

3. **Conversation History**: The client maintains a conversation history to provide context for future iterations.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Streaming Support**: Add support for streaming responses from Claude to improve responsiveness.

2. **Multi-Repository Support**: Add support for working with multiple repositories in a single session.

3. **Custom Tool Support**: Add support for custom tools to extend the functionality of the client.

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to provide more detailed error messages and recovery options.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the client for better performance, especially for large repositories.
