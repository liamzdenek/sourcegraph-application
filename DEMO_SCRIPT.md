## 1. Introduction (1 minute)
1. Hello Steve and Quinn, I'm Liam. I'm a hands-on SWE with extensive experience in LLMs and distributed systems.
2. I'm interested in working in Engineering at Sourcegraph.
3. Instead of sending a resume, I've built a functional demo that showcases both my technical skills and my understanding of your vision for SourceGraph.
4. I've created a Claude-powered Batch Changes Tool from scratch that addresses a critical gap in your current batch changes product offering: It's not well-equipped to handle repositories that aren't of uniform structure and tooling.
5. This platform allows teams to make automated changes across many unique repositories at once, minimizing grunt work, and maximizing engineering value.
6. I completed this project in just one day, demonstrating my ability to rapidly deliver value while maintaining high engineering standards.

7. I focused on building a production-ready, highly scalable solution that demonstrates a balance of technical excellence and practical business value

## 4. Conclusion & Why I'm a fit for Sourcegraph (1 minute)
1. Why I'm a fit for Sourcegraph
   1. I demonstrated alignment in a vision of AI, and a focus on real business problems that are relevant to Sourcegraph.
   2. I demonstrated my ability to rapidly deliver within a tight timeframe
   3. I believe I've demonstrated that I wouldn't simply meet the bar at Sourcegraph, I will raise it.

2. I'm particularly excited about Sourcegraph for several reasons:
   1. I believe that Agent Clusters and Agent Fleets are the future for developer productivity.
   2. I want to work in a high-leverage environment, where the company understands that $100+/engineer/day is inevitable
   3. Finally, I believe I can accomplish my major learning goal at Sourcegraph while delivering exceptional impact. (improve my product oriented-thinking)

3. I'm excited about the possibility of joining Sourcegraph and contributing to your vision of Agent Clusters and Fleets.
4. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing back
