## 1. Introduction (1 minute)
1. Hello Steve and Quinn, I'm Liam. I'm a hands-on SWE with extensive experience in LLMs and distributed systems.
2. I'm interested in working in Engineering at Sourcegraph.
3. Instead of a traditional application, I've built a functional demo that showcases both my technical skills and my understanding of your vision for SourceGraph.
4. I've created a Claude-powered Batch Changes Tool from scratch that addresses a critical gap in your current batch changes product offering: It's not Claude.
5. In the rapidly-evolving AI environment, which Sourcegraph hopes to pioneer, this platform allows teams to make automated changes across many repositories at once, minimizing grunt work, and maximizing engineering value.
6. I completed this project in just one day, demonstrating my ability to rapidly deliver value while maintaining high engineering standards.

## 2. User Experience & Business Impact (1.5 minutes)

## 4. Technical Architecture & Implementation (1.5 minutes) 
1. Front end. React/Vite, S3, Cloudfront
2. Back end. Lambda. API Gateway
3. Persistence. DynamoDB for storing configured experiments
4. Report. Java, AWS Batch.
5. CDK

6. I focused on building a production-ready, highly scalable solution that demonstrates a balance of technical excellence and practical business value, which I believe is what Sourcegraph is looking for in its Engineers.

## 5. Conclusion & Why I'm a fit for Sourcegraph (1 minute)
1. Why I'm a fit for Sourcegraph
   1. I demonstrated a focus on real business problems that are relevant to Sourcegraph.
   2. I demonstrated expertise in data collection, processing, and visualization
   3. I demonstrated my ability to rapidly deliver within a tight timeframe
   4. I believe I've demonstrated that I wouldn't simply meet the bar at Sourcegraph, I will raise it.

2. I'm particularly excited about Sourcegraph for several reasons:
   1. The chance to contribute to Sourcegraph's data-driven culture and your decision-making processes
   2. The impact of building systems that real people use to make their lives better
   3. Finally, I believe I can accomplish my major learning goal at Sourcegraph while delivering exceptional impact. (improve my product oriented-thinking)

3. I'm excited about the possibility of joining Sourcegraph and contributing to your mission of helping people achieve financial independence.
4. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing back
